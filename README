Introduction
------------

This project comprises the design and production of a web application that can
assist high school students in learning how to apply mathematical term
reductions.

The basic idea is that the student can work on an assignment using an online
text editor. The text entered in the editor is converted to a mathematical
notation and displayed on the screen in real-time. If the student gets stuck
while rewriting a mathematical formula, he or she can request a `hint' from the
system.

The system should recognize a best reduction to apply at that time, and guide
the student in the right direction by displaying a textual hint that tells the
user what sort of reduction can be applied. When asked the system should apply
an appropriate reduction step itself.

This project is implemented and designed by Taddeus Kroes
<taddeuskroes@hotmail.com> and Sander Mathijs van Veen <smvv@kompiler.org> and
supervised by drs. Krzysztof Apt of the CWI, Amsterdam.

Dependencies
------------

 - GNU Bison and Flex.
 - GNU GCC (or another decent C compiler).
 - Pyrex <http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/>.

In order to run the unit tests and and see how much coverage the unit tests
have, please install:

 - Python testrunner <http://git/kompiler.org/python/testrunner>.
 - Python coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>.

Deployment / Installation
-------------------------

Use the following commands in order to be able to deploy the term rewriting
system on a Linux box:

    git clone git@kompiler.org:trs
    cd trs
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    make -j4
